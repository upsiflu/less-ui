# Examples

**Install the live server:**

```shell
npm install -g elm-watch
npm ci
```

**Toy around:**
```shell
npm install -g elm-doc-preview
npm start
```

- Edit the files in src/ while watching a browser tab pointing at [localhost:8001](localhost:8001). A note to vscodium users: To activate the language server in your editor, choose "Open Folder..." and select `examples`.
- In that browser tab, you can activate the Elm debugger by clicking the `elm-watch` menu in the bottom left corner.
- Browse the documentation at [localhost:8000/packages/upsiflu/restrictive-examples](http://localhost:8000/packages/upsiflu/restrictive-examples/latest)
- Click on the `elm-watch hot` buttons in your terminal output to check for errors.

**Have a lot of fun <3**
